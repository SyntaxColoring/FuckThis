Introduction
============
FuckJava compiles [Brainfuck](http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/bf/) programs
to Java bytecode.  It emits standalone Java SE 5 class files.  FuckJava is
written in ANSI C (C90).

Usage Example
=============
    $ echo '++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..++
    +.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.>++.' > hello.bf
    $ ./fj hello.bf Hello.class
    $ file Hello.class
    Hello.class: compiled Java class data, version 49.0 (Java 1.5)
    $ java Hello
    Hello World!

For detailed instructions, run `./fj --help`.

Portability Notes - "FuckJava Flavored Brainfuck"
=================================================
Brainfuck, despite its simplicity, is not a well defined language.  Here is how
FuckJava behaves with respect to the language's ambiguities:

  - The array is 30,000 cells long and each cell is a byte.
  - Moving the index past array boundaries is allowed, but trying to access data
    there will crash the program.
  - The `,` command returns newlines exactly as they appear on the host
    filesystem (a 13 followed by a 10 on Windows, and just a 10 elsewhere).
  - The `,` command returns -1 when EOF is reached.

Building
========
Just run `make` in the root FuckJava directory to compile FuckJava. `make clean`
is also supported.
